<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

- Another step in my journey to master Responsive Design and Tailwindcss
- I learned a more about tailwindcss and improved my ability to write it fast.
- But this time it was hard and i was wrong, i didn't learn too much yet. i used position relative and absolute in the last two projects, which is not responsive at all.
- I started to use flex and i will use Grid, and i will do my best till i get used to them and make a real responsive design.
- Work hard, and the smart way here is to work more and invest all of your time in practice
